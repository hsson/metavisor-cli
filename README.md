# metavisor-cli
The `metavisor-cli` is a command-line interface to easily deploy cloud instances with the Metavisor.

The latest release of **metavisor-cli** is [1.0.1](https://github.com/immutable/metavisor-cli/releases/latest).

## Requirements
This CLI is implemented using [Go](https://golang.org) (version 1.10 to be specific). Go must be installed in order to compile the CLI. If you don't have Go installed, every release of the CLI is also accompanied by pre-compiled binaries for Darwin (macOS), Linux, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, and Windows which don't have any additional dependencies. To get the correct dependency versions when compiling, make sure to use the dependency management tool `dep`.

## Installation
The CLI can be installed and used by either compiling a binary from the source code by yourself, or by grabbing one of the pre-compiled binaries from the latest release of the CLI. Additionally, the package manager Homebrew can be used. Please follow the instructions below on how to do either of this.

### Install using Homebrew
If you're using macOS and have Homebrew setup, the CLI can be installed with this simple command:
```
$ brew install immutable/core/metavisor
```

### Install from source code
In order to compile the source code yourself, you either need to have Docker installed or you need a full Go environment properly setup. The dependency management tool `dep` is also required to compile without the use of Docker. Make sure that this project is cloned to `$GOPATH/src/github.com/immutable/metavisor-cli` so that dependencies are properly resolved, then run:
```
$ dep ensure
$ go build cmd/metavisor.go
```
OR run:
```
$ make build
```
OR if you want to compile using Docker, run:
```
$ make docker-build
```
After you have a compiled binary of the CLI, simply put it somewhere in your `$PATH` and you're ready to start using it. Try it out by running `metavisor version` (assuming you named the binary `metavisor`).

### Install from binary
If you decide you don't want to compile the source code yourself, there are pre-compiled binaries attached to every release. Make sure you grab the binary that is built for your system (e.g. get metavisor-darwin if you're on macOS). The steps for all platforms should be similar:

1) Download the binary
2) Make sure the binary is executable
3) Put the binary somewhere in your `$PATH`

Below follow some simple examples on how to do this on major platforms.
#### Linux
```
$ curl -L -o ./metavisor https://github.com/immutable/metavisor-cli/releases/download/v1.0.1/metavisor-linux
$ chmod +x ./metavisor
$ sudo mv ./metavisor /usr/local/bin/metavisor
```

#### macOS
```
$ curl -L -o ./metavisor https://github.com/immutable/metavisor-cli/releases/download/v1.0.1/metavisor-darwin
$ chmod +x ./metavisor
$ sudo mv ./metavisor /usr/local/bin/metavisor
```

#### Windows
If you have `curl` installed, download by running:
```
$ curl -L -o ./metavisor.exe https://github.com/immutable/metavisor-cli/releases/download/v1.0.1/metavisor-windows.exe
```
or, simply download by using this link: [Download CLI](https://github.com/immutable/metavisor-cli/releases/download/v1.0.1/metavisor-windows.exe). 

Finally, add the binary to your `$PATH`.

## Usage
Assuming you have the CLI installed and available in your `$PATH` as `metavisor`, you can find all available commands as well as their corresponding parameters by running:
```
$ metavisor help
```
In order to find more specific help for a command, e.g. for wrapping instances, run:
```
$ metavisor aws wrap-instance --help
```
The easiest way to try the Metavisor out is to wrap one of your existing instances with it. Here follows an example for wrapping an instance with the ID `i-foobar123456` which is running in the region `us-west-2`:
```
$ metavisor aws wrap-instance --region=us-west-2 --token=$YOUR_LAUNCH_TOKEN i-foobar123456
```
Notice the `--token` argument, where a so-called launch token must be specified (in this case saved in the `$YOUR_LAUNCH_TOKEN` environment variable). The launch token is required in order to allow the Metavisor to communicate with the [Metavisor Director Console](https://mgmt.brkt.com). You can get a launch token by logging into your account in the [Metavisor Director Console](https://mgmt.brkt.com) and navigating to the `Generate Userdata` section of the `Settings` tab, and then clicking: `Generate --> OK --> COPY TOKEN ONLY`.

### AWS Credentials
In order for the CLI to work properly, you need to have AWS credentials properly setup. This is done in the same way as for the official AWS CLI, and typically involves either specifying the environment variables `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, or by adding an AWS configuration in `~/.aws/config`. For more details on how to setup AWS credentials, take a look at the [getting started guide for the AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-getting-started.html). Even though the Metavisor CLI doesn't depend on the AWS CLI itself, the AWS credentials setup process is the same.

### AWS Permissions
The CLI requires a set of IAM permissions in EC2 in order to work properly. This is required to get the Metavisor up and running in your AWS account. An example policy template with the minimum permission requirements can be found in the `policy_template.json` file. These permissions must be present no matter which method you choose to authenticate against AWS (either directly in the credentials used or in a role that gets assumed using the credentials).

As a side note; if your credentials allow you to assume a certain role and you would prefer the CLI to use this role for a specific command, this can be achived by using the `--iam` flag in the CLI. Here is an example of wrapping an instance with the role `mv-cli-role` (assuming your AWS account ID is `123456789012`):
```
$ export YOUR_LAUNCH_TOKEN=<your launch token from Metavisor Director Console>
$ export ROLE=arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/mv-cli-role
$ metavisor aws wrap-instance --region=us-west-2 --token=$YOUR_LAUNCH_TOKEN --iam=$ROLE i-foobar123456
```

## Contributing
The metavisor-cli project uses `dep` to manage dependencies. For more information about `dep`, please take a look at [golang.github.io/dep/](https://golang.github.io/dep/).

The easiest way to install `dep` on macOS is through Homebrew:
```
$ brew install dep
$ brew upgrade dep
```

## Using Docker
If Go or `dep` is not installed, and you still want to compile from the source code, Docker can be used. The following `make` targets are available:
### `make docker-build`
Will compile a binary for your current system, e.g. if you're running Windows a binary called `metavisor.exe` will be created.

### `make docker-build-[darwin/linux/openbsd/freebsd/windows]`
This make target can be used to create a binary for the specified platform, regarless of which system you're currently using. E.g. running `make docker-build-darwin` on a Windows machine will create a binary called `metavisor`.

### `make docker-build-all`
Create binaries for Windows, Linux, OpenBSD, FreeBSD, and Darwin (macOS). The binaries will have a suffix indicating which platform they're built for. I.e. `make docker-build-all` outputs:

- metavisor-linux
- metavisor-darwin
- metavisor-openbsd
- metavisor-freebsd
- metavisor-windows.exe
